# Mistic Mart Application
it is also a java based desktop application in this application I have followed a pattern of MVC 		

There is also 2 main module in this project:-
1. Admin
2. Receptionist  
		
  
So the main focus of this application is to provide a SAAS-based product for a general store that will provide flexible billing services to users and transform the whole process digitally.  		So now I am defining main modularity of Admin - 	

1. Manage receptionist
2. Manage products
3. View all financial data

   		1. Manage receptionist -
		—> Add receptionist
		—> Remove receptionist
		—> Update receptionist
		—> View All receptionist 

		2. Manage products -
		—> Add products
		—> Remove products
		—> Update products
		—> View All products 

		3. View all financial data-
		—> View the total collection
		—> View the total collection by a receptionist  —> Cancel or update wrong billing 
		 		
Now I am defining the main modularity of Receptionist - 	
1. Billing
2. View all invoices by date
